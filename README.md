# Iron Man Mask Drawing using Turtle

This Python code utilizes the turtle module to draw the outline of Iron Man's mask. The code defines the coordinates for the mask's outline and uses the turtle graphics library to draw the mask on the screen.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have Python installed on your machine. The turtle module is included in the Python standard library, so no additional installations are required.

## Usage

1. Open a Python IDE or editor of your choice.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `iron_man_mask.py`).
3. Run the Python file.

Upon execution, a turtle graphics window will open, displaying the outline of Iron Man's mask. The mask consists of three parts: the main faceplate, the side plates, and the lower plate.

## Customization

If you wish to customize the appearance of the mask, you can modify the code accordingly. For example, you can add colors, shading, or additional details to make it more closely resemble Iron Man's mask.
